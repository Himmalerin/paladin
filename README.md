## Paladin

Paladin is a simple moderation bot with support for:

-   reaction roles
-   logging users joining/leaving the server
-   logging message edits and deletions
-   moderator actions (kicking/banning/unbanning users)
-   "banned words" filter (with thread support!)

Support is planned for:

-   logging user renames, avatar changes, and role changes
-   automatic logging of manual kicks/bans/unbans
